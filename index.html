<h1>Oracles in DLCs: Function, Limitations, and Modern Solutions</h1>

<h2>1. What Is an Oracle in DLCs?</h2>

<p>
In <em>Discreet Log Contracts</em> (DLCs), an <strong>oracle</strong> is an entity that publishes cryptographic
signatures about real-world events, enabling Bitcoin contracts to settle based on verifiable outcomes 
(e.g., prices, sports results, economic indices).
</p>

<p>To function as an oracle, an entity must:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Pre-define</strong> which events it will observe.</li>
    <li>Publicly <strong>commit</strong> to an oracle public key and message format.</li>
    <li>Publish a <strong>Schnorr signature</strong> for the actual event result.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Anyone can act as an oracle if they generate a key pair, disclose their public key and outcome encoding, 
and ensure <strong>availability</strong> and <strong>authenticity</strong> of signatures.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Limitations of Oracle Power in DLCs</h2>

<p>DLCs minimize trust by restricting the oracle’s influence:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The oracle does <strong>not know contract terms</strong> and does not participate in negotiation.</li>
    <li>The oracle does <strong>not control funds</strong> — all transactions are pre-signed.</li>
    <li>If an oracle <strong>lies</strong>, signing conflicting outcomes exposes its private key.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy</strong> hides which oracle or outcomes the contract uses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the oracle is essential, yet its direct power is limited.</p>

<h2>4. Modern Solutions to the Oracle Problem</h2>

<p>
As blockchain applications scale, reliable oracles become critical. Research increasingly explores 
<strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> as a complementary inference and filtering layer—not a trustless replacement.

    “AI offers techniques that enhance oracle systems across anomaly detection, adversarial resistance,
    intelligent node selection, automated fact extraction, and hybrid governance models.”

<h2>Final Summary</h2>

<p>
DLC oracles minimize trust through cryptography but face dilemmas around centralization, availability,
and data integrity. Modern research proposes <strong>AI-augmented oracle architectures</strong> to improve anomaly
detection, security, governance, and fact extraction. However, AI introduces new risks: hallucinations,
bias, model drift, and dependency on high-quality data.
</p>

<p>
AI should therefore be seen not as a replacement for trust assumptions but as a 
<strong>supplementary inference layer</strong> enhancing oracle reliability without removing the need for robust system design.
